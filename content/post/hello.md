Mass spectrometry and molecular dynamics simulation results extracted from Beveridge et al.29 a) Native mass spectrum of Fdc1 where a user can hover over mass spectrum line and reveal information about the sample (here m/z and intensity). b) A native mass spectrum of Fdc1UbiX showing how users can select and drag in the plot area to zoom in on any part of the spectrum. The inset is showing single charge state ([2M+22H]22+) where it is easy to observe the relative quantities of the apo, holo-1 and holo-2 forms of the protein. c) Secondary structure content computed over the course of the molecular dynamics simulation where users can hover over each line to reveal the time point, secondary structure content and the associated label. In addition, each component of the legend can be toggled on/off to either mute (as shown) or hide individual components.
